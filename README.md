# Capstone-Management
Capstone management system built with java springboot for OOAD project.

## Synopsis
The Capstone management project is a web-based application developed using Springboot that allows students, teachers, and admins to manage the details of capstone projects. The application has separate login portals for each user type, and each user has specific roles and functionalities.

Students can register to a team of four members and choose a domain and topic for their capstone project. Teachers can register as guides and get assigned to a team. They can also schedule weekly reviews for each team they are guiding. Admins can view consolidated details of the students, teams, and meetings scheduled, and make changes if necessary.

This project aims to simplify the process of managing capstone projects by providing a centralized platform for students, teachers, and admins to communicate and collaborate efficiently. It helps in improving the overall management of the project and ensures that all the stakeholders are on the same page.

The Capstone management project also includes various features that enhance the user experience,such as an interactive dashboard that provides a visual representation of the project status. The application is user-friendly, secure, and scalable, making it suitable for use in both small and large-scale projects. By using this project, educational institutions can streamline their capstone project management process, reduce errors and delays, and ensure timely completion of projects.
